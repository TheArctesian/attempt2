            <p>So I was going to use a method to just get user id's based off the handle but i figured out i
                had to restrict the amount of calls I made so I can run my method. So I just used a 
                <a href="https://tweeterid.com/">webstite</a> to do turn the handles into ids so i didnt have
                to do it everytime.
