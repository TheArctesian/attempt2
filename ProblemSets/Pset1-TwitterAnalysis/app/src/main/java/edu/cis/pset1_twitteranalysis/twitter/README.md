An Android Studio project that returns teacher recommendations

## Notes


- So I was going to use a method to just get user id's based off the handle but i figured out i had to restrict the amount of calls I made so I can run my method. So I just used a to do turn the handles into ids so i didnt have to do it everytime. [link](https://tweeterid.com/)

- I used a bunch of stack overflow someone ever responded to my question. [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69327917/how-do-turn-twitter-ids-to-username-in-twitter4j-or-can-i-use-id-to-get-a-user)
