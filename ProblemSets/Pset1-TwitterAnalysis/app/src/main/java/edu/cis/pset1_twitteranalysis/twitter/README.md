A Android Studio project that returns teacher recommendations

## Notes


- So I was going to use a method to just get user id's based off the handle but i figured out i had to restrict the amount of calls I made so I can run my method. So I just used a [a link](href="https://tweeterid.com/">webstite) to do turn the handles into ids so i didnt have to do it everytime. 

- I used a bunch of stack overflow 

- I have Android Studio
